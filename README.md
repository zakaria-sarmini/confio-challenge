# ConfioChallenge

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2 and developed using NodeJS 10.19.0.

## How to run the application

Clone the Project, install the packages `npm install`, and then run `ng serve` in root. Using your browser navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Notes

The Application expects a local Cosmos-SDK blockchain(v0.23.1) running in a Docker container and exposed at http://localhost:1317, if this is not the case please change the API url under `src/enviroment/enviroment.ts`.

## Further help

You might need to install the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) in order to run `ng serve` on your machine, in order to do that please run `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
